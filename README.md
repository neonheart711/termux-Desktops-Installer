> **Debian Proot + XFCE4 Desktop on Termux — One Script Setup**

---

## ⚡ Quick Install

Run this single command in Termux:

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neonheart711/Termux-Desktops-Installer/main/desktop_install.sh -O desktop_install.sh && chmod +x desktop_install.sh && bash desktop_install.sh
```

---

## 📋 What It Does

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 🔧 | Sets up Termux environment & storage |
| 📦 | Installs `x11-repo`, `tur-repo`, `pulseaudio`, `proot-distro`, `wget`, `git` |
| 🐧 | Installs **Debian** via proot-distro |
| 🖥️ | Installs **XFCE4** desktop inside Debian |
| 🚀 | Creates `debian` launcher command |

---

## 🚀 Usage

After installation, launch your desktop with:

```bash
debian
```

> ⚠️ Make sure **Termux:X11** app is open before running the launcher.

---

## 📱 Requirements

- **Termux** (latest from F-Droid — *not Play Store*)
- **Termux:X11** app installed
- Android **7.0+**
- At least **3 GB** free storage
- Stable internet connection

---

## 🗂️ Files Installed

```
$PREFIX/bin/debian          ← Desktop launcher command
~/.hushlogin                ← Silences Termux login message
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Storage permission denied?**
```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

**Debian already installed?**
```bash
proot-distro remove debian
proot-distro install debian
```

**Black screen in X11?**
- Open Termux:X11 first, then run `debian`
- Make sure display is set correctly inside the script
